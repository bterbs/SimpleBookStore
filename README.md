# SimpleBookStore
 Simple bookstore content management system that allows users to view, add, delete, and update books. Books entered in the system can be viewed in a list, as a single entry on its own page, or searched for using basic searches (by title, author, or genre).

 To run our lovely program:

 npm install

 npm run db:create (this will drop and create a db called bookstore_books, beware if you have a db with that name!)

 npm run db:init 

 npm start
